# python-inpout

Simple library for input/output using MessagePack and LZ4 compression in Python.

## Installation

You can use `pip` (or any PyPI-compatible package manager) for installation:

    pip install inpout

or, if you prefer a local user installation:

    pip install --user inpout

For Microsoft Windows users, you might need to run `pip` through the Python interpreter:

    python -m pip install inpout

**Note:** Visual C++ 14.0 is required for Windows installation. Get it with *Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools*: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>

## Usage

To use the functionality of this library, simply import it in your Python programs:

    import inpout


### High-Level Functions

For saving/loading data using MessagePack and LZ4 compression, the following high-level convenience functions are provided in the root namespace:

* `load_obj(path, **kwargs)`: return a single object loaded from a file on disk.

  See `data_unpacker()` for details on the keyword-arguments.

* `load_iter(path, **kwargs)`: return an iterator of objects loaded from a file on disk.

  See `data_unpacker()` for details on the keyword-arguments.

* `save_obj(obj, path, **kwargs)`: save a single object `obj` to a file on disk.

  See `data_pack()` for details on the keyword-arguments.

* `save_iter(iterable, path, **kwargs)`: save an interable of objects `iterable` to a file on disk.

  See `data_pack()` for details on the keyword-arguments.


### Context Manager Functions

For more flexibility, the following context manager functions are provided in the root namespace:

* `data_unpacker(path, compression=True, **kwargs)`: create a data unpacker (MessagePack) context manager with optional compression (LZ4) support to be used as an iterable unpacker.
  - `path`: path to the file on disk containing the data to read.
  - `compression`: boolean flag for using LZ4 compression.
  - `kwargs`: keyword arguments passed directly to the MessagePack unpacker. See below.

* `data_pack(path, compression=True, level=None, **kwargs)`: create a data pack (MessagePack) context manager with optional compression (LZ4) support to be used as a packing function.
  - `path`: path to the file on disk that will contain the written data.
  - `compression`: boolean flag for using LZ4 compression.
  - `level`: the compression level for the LZ4 compressor. See `compressor()` for details.
  - `kwargs`: keyword arguments passed directly to the MessagePack packer. See below.

### Packing Functions

For packing/unpacking data with MessagePack directly without compression, the following functions are provided in `inpout.packing`:

* `pack(obj, stream, **kwargs)`: pack a single object using MessagePack (with extended types support) to a stream of bytes.
  - `obj`: the object to pack.
  - `stream`: the bytes stream to use for writing data.
  - `kwargs`: keyword arguments passed directly to the MessagePack packer. See below.

* `packb(obj, **kwargs)`: pack a single object using MessagePack (with extended types support) and return packed bytes.
  - `obj`: the object to pack.
  - `kwargs`: keyword arguments passed directly to the MessagePack packer. See below.

* `unpack(stream, **kwargs)`: unpack a stream of packed bytes using MessagePack (with extended types support) and return a single unpacked object.
  - `stream`: the bytes stream to use for reading data.
  - `kwargs`: keyword arguments passed directly to the MessagePack unpacker. See below.

* `unpackb(packed, **kwargs)`: unpack packed bytes using MessagePack (with extended types support) and return a single unpacked object.
  - `packed`: the packed bytes to unpack.
  - `kwargs`: keyword arguments passed directly to the MessagePack unpacker. See below.

### Compressing Functions

For compressing/decompressing arbitrary data with LZ4 directly without packing, the following context manager functions are provided in `inpout.compression`:

* `decompressor(path)`: create a data decompressing context manager to be used as reader.
  - `path`: path to the file on disk containing the compressed data.

* `compressor(path, level=None)`: create a data compressing context manager to be used as a writer.
  - `path`: path to the file on disk that will contain the compressed data.
  - `level`: compression level to use. Defaults to `LZ4F_COMPRESSION_MAX` if `None`. Values lower than `3` (including negative ones) use fast compression. Recommended range for hc-type compression is between `4` and `9`. More information can be [found here](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/README.md).

### Keyword Arguments for MessagePack

Functions involving data packing with MessagePack support optional keyword arguments `kwargs` to be passed directly to MessagePack packer and unpacker. Useful options are described below:

* `use_list`: can be `True` (default) or `False`.

  List is the default sequence/array type for Python. But tuples are lighter than lists. You can use `use_list=False` while unpacking when performance is important for your program. Python objects that require hashable elements such as `dict` or `set` can't use lists as key, therefore `use_list=False` is required for unpacking data containing tuples as keys.

## Examples

Below is example code of how to use the main convenience functions of this library.

```python
from datetime import datetime
import inpout

# create some Python objects to test, set and datetime are supported out of the box
obj1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
obj2 = ("test", 1234)
obj3 = {"test": 1234, "test2": 5678}
obj4 = {"a", "b", "c", 5, 6, 7, 8}
obj5 = datetime.now()
obj6 = {(1,2): "tuple_key"}

# save all the above objects as a single tuple to disk
inpout.save_obj((obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4, obj5), "test1.mp.lz4")

# save all the above objects in order to disk one by one (iterator)
iterator = (o for o in (obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4, obj5))
inpout.save_iter(iterator, "test2.mp.lz4")

# save an object with a tuple as key to demonstrate 'use_list=False'
inpout.save_obj(obj6, "test3.mp.lz4")

# load the first test file
data = inpout.load_obj("test1.mp.lz4")
print("DATA=%r" % (data,))

# load the second test file (iterator)
for obj in inpout.load_iter("test2.mp.lz4"):
    print("OBJ=%r" % (obj,))

# load the third test file using tuple types, otherwise it fails
data = inpout.load_obj("test3.mp.lz4", use_list=False)
print("DATA=%r" % (data,))

# demonstrate the data pack function
with inpout.data_pack("test4.mp.lz4") as pack:
    for obj in (obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4, obj5, obj6):
        pack(obj)

# demonstrate the data unpacker function
with inpout.data_unpacker("test4.mp.lz4", use_list=False) as unpacker:
    for obj in unpacker:
        print("OBJ=%r" % (obj,))

# demonstrate the data pack function (no compression)
with inpout.data_pack("test4.mp", compression=False) as pack:
    for obj in (obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4, obj5, obj6):
        pack(obj)

# demonstrate the data unpacker function (no compression)
with inpout.data_unpacker("test4.mp", compression=False, use_list=False) as unpacker:
    for obj in unpacker:
        print("OBJ=%r" % (obj,))
```

## MessagePack Extended Types

This library supports MessagePack extended types and includes encoders/decoders for two standard Python objects: `set` (typecode `127`) and `datetime` (typecode `126`). These are automatically registered upon importing the library.

* `set` objects are serialised as tuples containing their elements and reconstructed from these stored tuples.
* `datetime` objects are serialised as a tuple of two integers `(seconds, microseconds)` representing the number of seconds and microseconds since the UNIX epoch (00:00:00 Thursday, 1 January 1970). Timezone information is used for the conversion but not stored, therefore `datetime` objects are reconstructed as naive, i.e. without timezone.

You can also easily create your own encoders/decoders for Python objects and register them for this library to be used during serialisation/deserialisation:

```python
import inpout

class MyType(object):
    def __init__(self, data1, data2):
        self.data1 = data1
        self.data2 = data2

# define a representation for your type (encoder)
# we will assign '50' as the typecode for this type
def encode_mytype(obj, packb, ext_type):
    return ext_type(50, packb((obj.data1, obj.data2)))

# define how to create your type from your representation (decoder)
def decode_mytype(data, unpackb):
    data1, data2 = unpackb(data)
    return MyType(data1, data2)

# register custom encoder/decoders for your type
inpout.packing.register_ext_type_encoder(MyType, encode_mytype)
inpout.packing.register_ext_type_decoder(50, decode_mytype)

# test saving/loading your type
obj = MyType("test", 1234)
inpout.save_obj(obj, "test.mp.lz4")
obj2 = inpout.load_obj("test.mp.lz4")
print(obj2.data1, obj2.data2)
```

You can use any typecode for your own extended types, however it must be between `0` and `125` (inclusive).

More information about MessagePack extended types can be [found here](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#extension-types).

## Command-line Tools

The library includes the following command-line tools that are installed automatically by `pip`:

* `inpout-pprint`: iterate and pretty-print data files generated by this library.

  This tool is based on the `load_iter` function with the `use_list=False` keyword argument. Compression is activated if filenames end with `.lz4` (case insensitive). Usage:

      $ inpout-pprint <FILE> <FILE> ...
